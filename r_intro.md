# Introduction to R

This is a short introduction to the R statistical computing language.  R is a
very powerful environment and language for statistics and data analysis.  It is
widely used in Bioscience research, and being able to use R is a skill that
many employers will value, in Biosciences and beyond.  R is very different from
Excel - instead of clicking around an interface, you do an R analysis by typing
commands for R to execute.  This takes some getting used to, but it has several
major advantages:

* it is much easier to record what you did in your analysis in a way that you
  can check and repeat;  this makes it easier to avoid and to spot mistakes
  (see [The Excel Error that Changed
  History](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-04-18/faq-reinhart-rogoff-and-the-excel-error-that-changed-history)
  for one particularly scary example);
* the underlying language gives you great power to adapt and extend your
  analysis; you are using the same tools as other bioscience and statistics and
  data science researchers, so it is easier to collaborate with them, and ask
  for advice; for the same reason there is lots of help and support for using
  R online.

For a short and cheerful start point, go to http://tryr.codeschool.com . Go
through the 8 short chapters there; they introduce you to the R language and
how to use it.   It should take about two hours, going nice and slow.

Next, consider this free online tutorial:

https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-inference-and-data-analysis.

In particular, have a look at the first two chapters, which are:

* Introduction to R (this will give you some revision, and some new features);
* Introduction to Data.

After you start the tutorials, the site, DataCamp, will ask you to make a free
account.

We think these two chapters will take you about 3 hours to complete, if you do not rush, and read the instructions carefully.

Now you may want to start using R yourself.  We strongly recommend you use the
[R Notebook](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html) to work in; it is
an excellent tool for showing and explaining your analysis as you go, and
making it easier for others to replicate what you did.

To use the Notebook, you will need to install the [R
language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com)
(see below). You will also need the R Studio Notebook packages installed on the
computer you are working on.  These are all completely free (no cost and
open-source).   There are a couple of videos on how to install these on:

* [Windows](vimeo.com/239492022);
* [macOS / OS X](vimeo.com/239497938).

If you're on Linux, we're pretty sure you can work it out for yourself.

Some people have had problems when trying to create new R Notebooks, with an error message that "One or more packages required for R Notebook creation were not installed".  If you get this error, try the fix at shown in [this video](https://vimeo.com/244451868).
