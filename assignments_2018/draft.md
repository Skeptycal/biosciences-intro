# Self-paced learning

1. Go to
   <https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT204x+3T2018/courseware>
1. You will get an edX login page.
1. Create an edX account if you don't have one.  You can
   use your `bham.ac.uk` address, or a personal address.
   You will get an email from edX to activate your
   account.
1. Log in.
1. You will see "You must be enrolled in the course to
   see course content.  Enroll now."  Click "Enroll now".
1. You might consider doing the whole course and getting
   a certificate.  This will cost you \$99, and take you
   around 3 times longer than doing the subset of the
   course we suggest here.  The learning will really help
   your data analysis skills for next term, and your
   third year, and the certificate may well be useful for
   your later job applications.  Your call.  If you do want to do this, ignore the rest of the instructions here, and do the full course.
1. From here, we assume you are doing the subset of the
   course, for the first-term assessment.
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the initial course page;
   you will see "Start Here", followed by a list of start
   activities, and then numbered course modules.
1. From the start activities, watch the "Welcome" video,
   and read "About this course".
1. Go to the first module "1. Basics".  Finish this
   module (2-4 hours).
1. Go to the module "2. Vectors".  Finish this module
   (2-4 hours).
1. Go to the module "4. Factors".  Watch the video.  Do
   the rest of the module if you have time. 6 minutes.
1. Go to the module "6. Data frames".  Finish this
   module (2-4 hours).

Total time estimated (by edX) 6 - 12 hours.

It took me around 2 hours 30 minutes.
