# First assignment

For this exercise, you are going to be working in the [R
Notebook](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

Make sure you have installed the R Notebook in R Studio first - see the videos
linked from the instruction page of this quiz.

Download a copy of the R Notebook template: `bio240_r_1.Rmd` (in this directory).

Open this file in R Studio.

Your task is to fill out the chunks in this notebook template, following the
instructions you will see in the notebook text.

Make sure that, when you have finished, you can run all the chunks in the
Notebook without any errors, because we will be doing the same when we grade
the Notebook. If the code doesn't work when we run it, you won't get the marks.
See the text in the notebook for more explanation. When you are confident that
your notebook runs correctly, upload it here.
